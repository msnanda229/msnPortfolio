          I am Medisetty Shanmukha Nanda, currently graduating from Narasaraopeta Engineering College, 
          pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

          I am a passionate software developer skilled in Python programming, full-stack web development 
          using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and artificial intelligence. 
          With a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving, I build efficient, scalable, and innovative applications.

          I enjoy working on both frontend and backend technologies and have hands-on experience 
          creating dynamic web apps, APIs, and intelligent AI-powered solutions. Iâ€™m always eager 
          to learn new tools and technologies to keep up with the fast-evolving tech landscape and 
          apply them to solve real-world problems.

          Driven by curiosity and continuous growth, I strive to deliver clean, maintainable code 
          while collaborating effectively within teams. My goal is to contribute to impactful 
          projects that combine software development and AI to create meaningful user experiences.
